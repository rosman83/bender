# Brandsmith ⚒️

Claim and check usernames and profiles across all the social profiles that matter.

Initially I created this as I wanted to start a youtube channel, and didn't want to spend all the time making social profiles across other sites like instagram. So what did I do? I ended up taking arguably 100x more time to craft an overengineered tool to do this...

Was it worth it?
